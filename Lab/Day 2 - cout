//Day 1 was just learning how to use the program we utilize in class. Lab class is a bit more fast paced.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {

    cout << "Edward Gomez" << endl;
    
    cout << "3 + 4 - 7" << endl;
    
    cout << "Get on with the program!" << endl;
    
    cout << "    * " << endl;
    cout << "   *** " << endl;
    cout << "  ***** " << endl;
    cout << " ******* " << endl;
    cout << "*********" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
